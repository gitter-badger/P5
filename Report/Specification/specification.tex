This chapter is documentation of the requirement engineering process, as describe in \cite{sommerville}. The structure will follow the elicitation process of requirements, by the methods included in sommerville's book. Some contributing methods used to describe the problem domain are borrowed from \cref{OOAD}.

\begin{itemize}
\item The light in a users home will be turned off when not in need for it
\item The light management invisible to the user, light is turned on before a user can observe this behaviour.
\item Will learn usage patterns of the user, turn on light at specific time of day or at a specific light intensity.
\end{itemize}

From the system definition and "rich picture" of the problem domain that the system will be operating, we can extract some classes, \quote{A description of a collection of objects with the same structure, behaviour and attributes}, as described in \cref{OOAD}. This classes will be beneficial when figuring out what we need to keep track of in the problem domain, or what is relevant in our model of the problem domain.

Classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Person - The user of the system
\item Action - An action the system should recognise as feedback
\item Pattern - The usage patter of a user, what is typical behaviour
\item Mistake - System did something wrong by the user
\item Sensor - The observational member of the system
\item Switch - A feedback source
\item Lamp - The light source on which system action
\item Light intensity - Luminance
\item Room - What room is the user in
\item Premise - The user home enviroment
\item Time - At what time, a pattern property
\end{itemize}

\item The user should be in doubt that the system will eventually turn off the light.
\item The should not be afraid that the system will suddenly turn off the light, whilst the user is need of it.
