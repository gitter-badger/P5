\section{Problem Formulation}
In the previous chapters, the current state of home automation as well as the users thereof were analysed and discussed. During these discussions, some concerns and delimitations for the scope of this project were presented. Taking these into consideration, a concrete problem formulation was devised, presenting a solvable problem in a delimited domain of home automation. The problem formulation is as follows:

How is it possible to create a system, that uses various sensors to learn usage patterns in a house/apartment, in order to intelligently minimise power usage, and automate trivial tasks, while being able to improve its automated actions?
