\section{Conclusion and Specification}
This section will conclude on the analysis and from the knowledge gathered define requirements.

The system should focus on creating a smart home system, see \cref{sec:interviewReports}, that focus on ligthing and electronic appliances. It should do so by utilising machine intellegence with machine learning in a manner that does not disturb the daily routines of the user by
\begin{itemize}
  \item Being conservative, see \cref{sec:interviewReports}, meaning that it is better not to act then to act wrongly
  \item Being reactive, meaning that the user should not notice any delay from the initiation of events to the execution
\end{itemize}

The setup and usage of the system should focus on fulfilling the following three criteria in relation to the user, found from \cref{sub:existingSystems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cheap
  \item User friendly
  \item Personalised
  \item Flexible
\end{itemize}

From section \cref{sub:Technologies} we have that the system must have sensor vararity that can cover
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time
  \item Ligth intensity
  \item Location and spacial awareness
  \item Awareness of active devices
\end{itemize}
