Home automation is a growing industry and is slowly gaining ground with the users. More and more homes are getting automated, but it is still a rather unexplored technology and far from every home has it. Though the technology is progressing, home automation has been quite a long time under way, compared with nearly all other electronics- and IT technologies. The concept was first introduced in the 1930s during many of the fairs around the world, especially the 1933 "Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition" at the "A Century of Progress International Exposition" in 1933 to 1934 in Chicago, USA. So even with over 80 years in the making it is still a rarity to own, or for that matter, eveng knowing someone that owns, a home automation system. Compared to mobile phones, first commonly theorised in 1948 in the science fiction novel Space Cadet by Robert Heinlein, and now with modern society practically demanding people to own one, that is at maximum 2-3 years old, home automation seems to be lagging behind. So how come that this is the case? How come that this technology is so hard to make popular? To find out, we first look at the state of the art and the currently leading products to find out what they do and essentially could be missing, or even doing wrong.
