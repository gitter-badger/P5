Home automation is a growing industry and is slowly gaining ground with the users. More and more homes get more and more automated, but it is still an unexplored technology and we are far from every home having it. Though the technology is progressing, Home Automation have been quite a long time under way compared with nearly all other electronics and IT technologies. It was first introduced in the 1930s during many of the fairs around the world, especially the 1933 Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition at the A Century of Progress International Exposition in 1933 to 1934 in Chicago. So even with over 80 years in the business it is still a rarity to own, or for that matter eveng knowing someone that own, a Home Automation system. Compared to mobile phones, first commonly theorised in 1948 in the science fiction novel Space Cadet by Robert Heinlein, and now with modern society practically demanding people to own one that is at maximum 2-3 years old, Home Automation seems to be lagging behind. So how come that this is the case? How come that this technology is so hard to make popular. To find out we first look at the state of the art and the currently leading products to find out what they do and essentially could be missing or doing wrong. Many systems exists that could be looked at but the following where chosen due to their representation of the different aspects and relative high popularity.
