\section{Conclusion}
In this section it were first described possible systems for Home Automation in an effort to describe already explored ways to affect the problem domain. From the existing system, we delimited the problem domain by excluding already well explored solutions. It showed that while most aspects of Home Automation are covered no system includes machine learning.

Based on the analysis done in this section this project will focus on controlling simple applications in the home using machine learning in an effort to reduce the interaction required from the user.
