\subsection{Conclusion}
In this section possible systems for home automation were described in an effort to describe already explored ways to affect the problem domain. It is shown that while most aspects of home automation are covered, no system includes machine learning.

Based on the analysis done in this section, this project will focus on controlling simple applications in the home, using machine learning, in an effort to reduce the interaction required by the user.
