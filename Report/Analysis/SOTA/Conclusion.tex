\section{Conclusion}
In this section it were first described possible usecases for Home Automation in an effort to define the problem domain and (de?)limit this projects size. Then existing systems in this space were researched to identify what parts of Home Automation is already solved. It showed that while most aspects of Home Automation are covered no system includes machine learning.

Based on the analysis done in this section this project will focus on controlling simple applications in the home using machine learning in an effort to reduce the interaction required from the user.
