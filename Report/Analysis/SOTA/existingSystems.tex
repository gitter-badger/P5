\subsection{Existing Systems}
In this section, some of the most popular home automation systems and their functionality will be discussed.
\subsubsection{Home Seer}
Home Seer is one of the highest rated systems on the market. It is a modular home automation system where the users are able to control and monitor their homes via an application on their smart phones. The user buys a controller that is the central computer controlling the system and can after that buy a very large range of modules of different types spanding over multiple brands depending on which controller they own. The system is split into 17 main categories.\footnote{The categories will not be explained in detail here but will be used and explained more in detail in the design if they are used.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lighting
	\item Thermostats / Climate Control
	\item Door Locks
	\item Garage Doors
	\item Cameras
	\item Security Systems
	\item Appliances
	\item Sensors
	\item Water Management
	\item Shades / Blinds
	\item Voice, Telephony
	\item Audio / Video / Media
	\item Energy Management
	\item Weather
	\item Automobile
	\item Fitness / Wearables
	\item Pool / SPA Control
\end{itemize}%Source: http://www.homeseer.com/compatible-products.html
When the devices are connected to the controller the system can be controlled by any computer on the local network using the special designed software HS3/HS3PRO. In this software the user is able to manage the controller to set-up, manage and remove hardware in the system and using these program his or her home. This can be done by setting up automated events like turning on lights at sunset or locking the door and closing the garage door when the car leaves the driveway. The system can also be set up to be controlled and monitored via the application on their mobile device like seeing which ligths are turned on and being able to turn them off remotely.%http://www.homeseer.com/guides/HomeSeer-QuickStart-Guide.pdf

\subsubsection{Control4}
Control4 is in many the more user-friendly version of Home Seer. An expert is assigned to the user and they together work out what the users needs are and how they want their home to be automated. The home is a lot less modular but is customised to the people using it, both in software and hardware. This also makes it possible for Control 4 to focuses more on the home \enquote{knowing} when to do something, and actively doing it instead of relying on inputs from the user like an app or alike. This also makes for generally better received products but at a lot higher cost.%http://www.control4.com/

\subsubsection{Samsung: SmartThings}
Samsung: SmartThings is effectively midway between Home Seer and Control4. It tries to make a user friendly and partly customisable smart home but at a relative low price. This is done using common patterns for people, like coffee brewing in the morning and washing of clothes before arrival at home again. The set-up is short and only consists of few questions for the user to personalise the experience to some degree. This is not as personalised as Control4 and Home Seer can be and is limited by the use cases designed by Samsung, but is a lot cheaper then Control4 and a lot easier and more user friendly then Home Seer.

The system, when in use, works as a conversation between the user and system making the user trigger certain events like morning routines by sending the message \enquote{Goodmorning} and reporting with usefull information and status like \enquote{The weather forecast for today is \dots Setting the temperature to 24\degree  and starting to brew your coffee.}

\subsubsection{Apple: HomeKit}
HomeKit is a framework for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user's home. %Directly copied from https://developer.apple.com/homekit/
This system is designed for superusers and programmers to use Apples voice activation and recogniser software Siri to be able to control their Home Automation system via voice commands.

\subsubsection{Summary}
The different home automation systems which exist today are very capable in the areas of the home which can be automated. However, all of these systems are very static in their behaviour, that is, they all operate according to their predefined behaviours, unable to change their behaviour to meet the user's changing needs, unless explicitly reprogrammed to do so. Following this train of thought, a market for a self-learning home automation system should exist, since such a system should be able to lessen the toll on the user, or expert, by removing the need to continuously configure the system.
