\subsection{Areas of Home Automation}
\label{sec:Areas of Home Automation}
There is a certain amount of tasks, which has to be done on a daily basis in a typical household. These could be trivial tasks such as turning off the light when leaving the bathroom or more advanced ones as cooking dinner or doing laundry. Depending on what type of task, it is desirable to automate it in manner to increase the quality of life.
\\\\
In this section, some of the major areas which are usually considered in home automation systems will be discussed.
The major areas are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Security
  \item Surveillance
  \item Light Automation
  \item Entertainment Automation
  \item Climate Control
\end{enumerate}
These will be expanded on below.

\subsubsection{Security}
\label{sub:Security}
A specific area of security in home automation could be detection of fire, turning off the oven after it is done.
+Detecting a fire at the right moment is crucial as it could save either life or property.
+Monitoring and reporting hazardous events to a central in order to receive help in sufficient time automatically
+will mean there will be less to worry about and thus will improve on the quality of life.

\subsubsection{Surveillance}
\label{sub:Surveillance}
Automation in this area boosts the security.
This type of automation is concerned with making the owner able to keep track of, for example, who is at the door and
thereby giving the user the choice of opening door remotely.

\subsubsection{Lighting Automation}
\label{sub:Lighting Automation}
Keeping track of lights in a home is a very typical task which has to be done daily. Automation in this area will not only increase the comfort of the user, but also help the environment by reducing waste and increasing efficiency. The system could detect the amount of light as well as monitoring sunrise and sunset and thereby turning offlight, when the light is not needed and thereby save energy.

%%\subsubsection{Entertainment Automation} \kanote{lav om til %%appliances, dvs. basically alt der kommer til at stå på standby %%rundt omkring i huset. Merge med lighting?}
%%\label{sub:Entertainment Automation}
%%Another, slightly different, area is entertainment automation. A way %%to put several entertainment devices together such that they can %%interact with each other and in that way increase the convenience in %%using certain products. An example could be that the home theatre %%system interacts with the lights in the room as well as the climate %%system and thereby can create a theatre environment on demand.

\subsubsection{Climate Control}
\label{sub:Clitemate Control}
A trivial task that is maintained on a daily basis is indoor heatcontrol; cooling the house down when it gets too hot and heating it up again when it gets too cold. Automation of heat control inside thehome can contribute to solving environmental issues by automaticallyand intelligently monitoring and regulating the room temperature. Bymonitoring environmental influences, such as the weather and theuser's preferred temperature, this task could be optimised to saveenergy and improve the life quality of the user.

\subsubsection{Delimitation}
Many different areas of the home can be automated by a home automation system. However, if a system is to be self-learning, there needs to be room for the system to make mistakes; thus some critical areas, suchas security, should not be automated by such a system. Some of theseareas also fit better with the idea of saving energy; lighting androom temperature regulation automation are perhaps the areas whichhave the biggest potential for saving energy. Therefore these areasare chosen as the main focus of this project.
