\subsection{Interfaces}
\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
One of the requirements found was that the system should be as invisible for the user as possible. Meaning that the optimal user interface for the system would be no user interface, rendering  interaction from the user needless. Since the system is relying on machine learning to advance its knowledge about the usepatterns of the user and any system in a learning environment is able to make mistakes and must be able to learn from these the user needs some way to inform the system that it has made a mistake. The interface could also be able to inform the system when it has made a correct action but since the goal of the system is to make only right choises in the end, the user would constant need to interact with the system thereby going against the principle of invisibility. The system will therefore assume no interaction means correct behaviour.
