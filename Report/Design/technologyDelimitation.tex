The system will consist of two parts: an embedded systems part, which will go on
the appliances or lights the users wants the system to control, and a central
computer for managing the embedded systems. The embedded systems won't have any graphical input interface but will have an interface through switches, and the output will be the turning on and off of the appliances
as well as collecting information about the user's usage patterns.
The central manager needs a way to present the action history of the individual embedded systems in a clear manner to the user.
And also allow for the user to easily and quickly distinguish the actions from each other and tell the system if any of them were incorrect.
This requires the manager to have a clear and distinguishable interface between the individual embedded systems.
