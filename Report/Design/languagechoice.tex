Reasoning for choosing languages:

Embedded:
  Needs to run on arduino machine(must be compilable to arm)
  Effiencient in instruction usage and memory usage

For the ai subsystem:
  It would be pratical with highly dynamic datastructure for when searching the state space
  Already implemented searching/splitting/VE algorithms.
