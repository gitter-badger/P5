Reasoning for choosing languages:

Embedded:
  Needs to run on Arduino machine(must be compilable to arm)
  Efficient in instruction usage and memory usage

For the AI subsystem:
  It would be practical with highly dynamic data structure for when searching the state space
  Already implemented searching/splitting/VE algorithms.
