\subsection{PIR Motion Sensor}

The sensor used to detect movement is a passive infrared sensor (PIR). The model
number is \enquote{SEN32357P} and is manufactured by SEEED Studio. A data sheet
can be found on:
\cite{datasheet_pir1}. The
sensor is implemented using the \enquote{BISS0001} IC. A datasheet for this can
be found on \cite{datasheet_pir2}.

According to the technical specifications, the sensor can measure movements from 0.1 m to 6
m away. The distance can be configured by rotating a potentiometer on the
sensor. Clockwise means decreasing the distance. This is essentially the
sensitivity of the sensor. A lesser distance means lower sensitivity. The detecting angle is 120 degree.

The sensor also has a potentiometer for configuring the time delay. The time
delay is the time the sensor reports movement after a movement is detected. So
if a movement is detected, the sensor with time delay 10 seconds is guaranteed
to report motion detected for 10 seconds. The time delay on this specific sensor
can be adjusted from 1 second to 25 seconds. A switch on the sensor controls
whether the sensor is retriggerable (H position) or unretriggerable (L
position). In a retriggerable position the delay time is extended every time
movement is detected. In the unretriggerable mode, the delay time remaining is
not reset when motion is detected.

The sensor has 4 pins, GND, VCC, NC and SIG. The sensor signals motion detected
on its SIG pin. Low on this pin means no motion and HIGH means motion.
