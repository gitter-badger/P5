\section{Hardware}
This section discusses hardware that is used to accomplish a desired solution.  The hardware is described, tested, and reviewed. A brief description of the hardware is included in this section followed by a review of the hardware.

\subsection{PIR Motion Sensor}

The sensor used to detect movement is a passive infrared sensor (PIR). The model
number is \enquote{SEN32357P} and is manufactured by SEEED Studio. A data sheet
can be found on:
\cite{datasheet_pir1}. The
sensor is implemented using the \enquote{BISS0001} IC. A datasheet for this can
be found on \cite{datasheet_pir2}.

According to the technical specifications, the sensor can measure movements from 0.1 m to 6
m away. The distance can be configured by rotating a potentiometer on the
sensor. Clockwise means decreasing the distance. This is essentially the
sensitivity of the sensor. A lesser distance means lower sensitivity. The detecting angle is 120 degree.

The sensor also has a potentiometer for configuring the time delay. The time
delay is the time the sensor reports movement after a movement is detected. So
if a movement is detected, the sensor with time delay 10 seconds is guaranteed
to report motion detected for 10 seconds. The time delay on this specific sensor
can be adjusted from 1 second to 25 seconds. A switch on the sensor controls
whether the sensor is retriggerable (H position) or unretriggerable (L
position). In a retriggerable position the delay time is extended every time
movement is detected. In the unretriggerable mode, the delay time remaining is
not reset when motion is detected.

The sensor has 4 pins, GND, VCC, NC and SIG. The sensor signals motion detected
on its SIG pin. Low on this pin means no motion and HIGH means motion.

An example of a setup can be seen in \cref{fig:arduino_pir_wiring}.

\subsubsection{Sampling Input Data}

To reduce noise on the signal of the sensor, a simple statistical algorithm is
employed on the input data. Essentially the data is reduced to two tiers
of data. First, the input data is accumulated into a tier1 low and a tier1 high
counter. When $n_{tier1}$ number of samples have been colliwcted, a tier2 sampling round begins. If tier1
had more high counts than low counts, tier2 high is incremented and the opposite if
tier1 had the most lows. When the sample count of tier2 has reached a number
$n_{tier2}$, the calculated signal can be reported. If tier2 had the most highs,
report high and vice verca for tier2 lows.
