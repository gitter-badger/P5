\section{Photoresistor Experiments}
A photoresistor is a variable resistor that reacts to light. Meaning that the more light the less $\Omega$ the resistor exerts. The photoresistor used in this project have the part number VT90N2 and the datasheet can be found here \cite{photoresistor_sheet}. As can be seen in the datasheet this resistor have a typical resistance of 24k $\Omega$ when at 10 lux (a lux scale can be found at \cite{lux_scale}) and when in darkness(meaning 0 lux) 500k $\Omega$. Response time above 1 foot-candle(fc)\footnote{foot-candle is a light measurement unit like lux, 1 fc ~= 10.8 lux} are below 0.1 seconds. Below 1 fc the response time can increase up to 0.8 seconds. At 0 \degree C there can be up to about 13\% variance, at 40 \degree C the variance can be upto 20\%. While this is a high variance the variance normalizes to 0\% at around 25 \degree C. The photoresistor is sensitive to light below the visible range. It is below 18\% sensitive to some wavelengths below 400 nm, which means ultraviolet light could affect readings. It is below 5\% sensitive to light above 800 nm which means infrared light should not meaningfully affect the readings. (\ranote{loads of data points, how many graphs, if any should be included. All the data are from the datasheet}

Because the resistor is too sensitive for the purpose of this project a pulldown resistor is used \cite{pulldown_resistor}. A pulldown resistor lowers the base value, this means that we can detect higher levels of light. An example setup can be seen in \cref{arduino_photoresistor_wiring}
