%Comfort is also a requirement beside minimising power usage.

\label{problemStatement}

How is it possible to create a system, that uses various sensors to learn usage patterns in a house/apartment, in order to intelligently minimise power usage (and automate trivial tasks) while being able to improve its automated actions?

Many sensors working together to learn usersâ€™ usage patterns, e.g. everyday at about 7.30, sensor 1 is activated and then the user turns the light on. This could be learned by a machine so that the next time sensor 1 is activated at about 7.30, the system automatically turns on the light.
